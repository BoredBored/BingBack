# BingBack
A short python script that auto-downloads the Bing Wallpaper of the day to be your desktop background.

## Notes:
The backgound setting feature has not been thoroughly tested and has only been used so far on Linux Mint.

If you would like to try it out just set the global variable `SetDestopWallpaper` to true.

## Install
No install, just run `python BingBack.py` to get the current Bing image of the day.
