# BingBack
A short python script that auto-downloads the Bing Wallpaper of the day to be your desktop background.

## Notes:
The backgound setting feature has not been thoroughly tested and has only been used so far on Linux Mint.

If you would like to the wallpaper module out just set the global variable `SetDestopWallpaper` to true.

## Install
Just run `python BingBack.py` to get the current Bing image of the day, if it detects that it has not created the necessary folders then it will automatically create them.
